Test plans: 
-mymalloc() should allocate memory
    - should not allocate more when full
    - should allocate without overlapping
    - should only allocate specified size
-myfree() should free memory 
    - should only free specified chunk
    - should free entire chunk (not from the middle)
    - should automatically coalece 

Malloc checks:
1. Allocate something that is larger than memory array size     // expect error
2. Allocate something that is smaller than array size           // expect success
3. Allocate something that is larger than available space       // expect error

Free checks: 
1. Free something that was not initialized through malloc       // expect error
2. Free something that is not at the start of the chunk         // expect error
3. Free something a second time                                 // expect error
