Test plans: 
-mymalloc() should allocate memory
    - should not allocate more when full
    - should allocate without overlapping
    - should only allocate specified size
-myfree() should free memory 
    - should only free specified chunk
    - should free entire chunk (not from the middle)
    - should automatically coalece 

Malloc checks:
-

Free checks: 
- Free something that was not initialized through malloc       //expect error
- Free something that is not at the start of the chunk         //expect error
- Free something a second time                                 //expect error


Memgrind Testing:
