Test plans: 

Malloc should:
- should not allocate more when full
- should allocate without overlapping
- should only allocate specified size

Free should:
- should only free specified chunk
- should free entire chunk (not from the middle)
- should automatically coalece 

Malloc checks:
- Allocate something that is larger than memory array               //expect error
- Allocate something that is larger than available space in array   //expect error
- Allocate something that fits in memory array capacity             //expect success

Free checks: 
- Free something that was not initialized through malloc            //expect error
- Free something that is not at the start of the chunk              //expect error
- Free something a second time                                      //expect error
- Free something that has been allocated (only data allocated)      //expects success
